/**
 * PA4 — three sources to one canonical order model.
 *
 * Three systems you do not control each send you an order in their own
 * shape:
 *
 *   data/web-order.json      nested JSON, web store
 *   data/mobile-order.json   flat JSON, abbreviated field names, mobile app
 *   data/b2b-order.xml       EDI-style XML, CP1257 ("windows-1257"), B2B partner
 *
 * Your job is the message translator, content enricher and content filter
 * patterns from this week's session, applied together:
 *
 *   1. Translator  — map each source's shape onto ../../canonical/order.schema.json.
 *      That schema is fixed. You conform to it; you do not adjust it.
 *   2. Enricher    — the sources do not carry a trustworthy price. Normalize
 *      each line item's product id to the pricing API's PROD-XXX format, call
 *      the API, and use ITS price, currency and tax rate. A price you typed
 *      into this file yourself is a hardcoded price, and a public test
 *      changes a price in the mock catalog specifically to catch that.
 *   3. Filter      — all three sources carry payment details (a card number,
 *      or an IBAN). The canonical schema has no field for any of it.
 *      Whatever you do with it, it must not reach the object you return.
 *
 * Everything you need to call the pricing API is in the Node standard
 * library (global fetch). The one dependency here, fast-xml-parser, exists
 * because hand-rolling an XML tokenizer is not this week's lesson — reading
 * the object it gives you back correctly is.
